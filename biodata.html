        <h1>Background Of My Biodata</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Fatin Nur Zulaika Binti Fairul Nizam </strong>, a 20-year-old Information Management student with a passion for exploring new skills and knowledge. 
            Born at <i>Hospital Putrajaya</i> on<i>25 June 2004</i>, I hail from <i> Banting, Selangor,</i> a quiet and quaint hometown that I would call "boring." 
            To break away from the routine, I often head to the scenic parks of Putrajaya, where jogging clears my mind and keeps me energized.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most exciting parts of my studies has been diving into web development. This subject has opened up a creative outlet for me, allowing me to build websites while sharpening my technical skills, a journey I truly enjoy and look forward to mastering.

        <h2>Love for Information Management</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            What drew me to study Information Management was my love for understanding systems and organizing information. Also, this field didn’t require mathematics since I don't like mathematics. 
            This choice opened the door to subjects like web development, which has become one of my favorite parts of the journey. I find joy in bringing ideas to life through code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a degree in Information Systems or an IT-related field.

        <h2>About My Family</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I come from a supportive and loving family of five, where each member plays a unique role in shaping who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            My father, 46, works as an IT Engineer at Prasarana Malaysia Berhad. His expertise in technology has always inspired me, and his dedication to both work and family is something I deeply admire.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mother, also 46, is a manager nurse at Institut Kanser Negara (IKN) Putrajaya. Her compassion and tireless commitment to helping others have taught me the importance of empathy and resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am the middle child of three siblings. My elder sister, 21, is currently pursuing her degree in Accounting. Her determination and focus motivate me to strive for success in my own journey. My younger brother, 16, is still in high school and brings energy and curiosity to our family dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
            We share countless memorable moments, from family outings to everyday conversations that keep us connected. My family is my anchor, and their love and encouragement fuel my aspirations and dreams.
